All the scripts in this directory contain user instructions in the first few lines of the script, please refer to the individual scripts for instructions.In order to use the test data provided to test the DMR caller the window size parameter has to be adjusted first. In order to do that go to the source code of the DMR caller version that you are using and change:window_id = int(float(position)/1000) into:window_id = int(float(position)/10)The line number of that parameter differs depending on the version but in every version that line appears once only. After having made the change proceed with the testing procedure by running the DMR caller on the test data normally as described in the user instructions for the DMR caller.
